"""Screen contract, and where D19's beginner rules are made structural.

D19 lists four rules. Three of them are cheap to state and easy to erode once
there are fifteen modules of content, so they are enforced here rather than
left to discipline:

1. **Every screen names its own exits.** `hints()` returning nothing raises.
2. **Esc always goes back.** The base handler maps it, and a screen that
   overrides `handle` still falls through to the base for keys it ignores.
3. **No screen is ever blank.** `body()` returning nothing raises.
4. **Nothing needs a key you were never shown.** Solved by construction rather
   than by assertion: `ListScreen` owns both its navigation keys and the hints
   describing them, so the two cannot drift apart.

Screens return `Text`, never strings with escape codes, so `test.py` can render
each one at every rung of the D20 ladder and check widths.
